        <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>

            <p> A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text. </p>

        <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Presentational markup</strong> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text <em>(e.g. Microsoft Word)</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Procedural markup</strong> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text <em>(e.g. TeX)</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Descriptive (logical) markup</strong> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed <em>(e.g. HTML)</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2. HTML</h3>

                <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>

                <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

                <h4>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
                        <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
                        <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
                        <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</ol>
                    </ol>
